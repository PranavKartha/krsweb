tall children suffer the most
it's so much easier to run away when the world can't see your face

i was born long and lanky
to a perfect family
with arms and legs that should have fit another boy

the tiny breaths that i was taking
when i was running on the playground
weren't enough to run as fast as i desired


the pointed fingers were my teachers
the crying voices with words so eager
i had no choice except to take the punishment

i was born an easy target
a failure before i started
a blade of grass too tall to be left alone
